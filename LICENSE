Commons Clause

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor grants
   to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, irrevocable (except as
   stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
   sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only
   to those patent claims licensable under this License by a Contributor because
   the Work is based on an API or other specifications that are subject to open
   specification commitments of the initial version of the Standard (defined below).
2. Notwithstanding Section 1, each Contributor retains all rights in and to any
   Contribution or portion thereof, including without limitation any patent claims,
   copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how, and other intellectual property
   rights thereto, to the extent that such rights are not so sublicensed under this
   License. You agree not to assert (or cause to be asserted) against any Entity any
   patent or other proprietary right arising from the use of a Contribution or portion
   thereof by that Entity with respect to the Work, unless You have entered into a
   separate agreement with that Entity covering such rights.
3. For the purposes of this License, "Entity" shall mean an individual or legal entity
   exercising rights under this License, but shall not include persons who contribute
   Covered Software in accordance with Section 6(b)(2) for the enhancement (not as
   Members of a corporate body) and to distribute objects compiled from it at no
   substantial cost.
4. Each Entity may grant licenses under this License to any recipient, including not-for-
   profit organizations and government entities.
